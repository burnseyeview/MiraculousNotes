-a group can do everything an individual cant.

you are in prison--all you can wish for is to escape...tunnel under a wall
		-- a group can help complete the escape tunnel
		=- need to help guide the reset
		-- prison/escape from prison-
	-- G. often returned afterwards to this example of "prison" and "escape from prison" in his  talks.  Sometimes  he  began  with  it,  and  then  his  favorite  statement  was  that,  if  a  man  in  prison  was  at  any  time  to  have  a  chance  of  escape,  then  he  must  first  of  all  realize that he is in prison. So long as he fails to realize this, so long as he thinks he is free, he has no chance whatever.


fusion inner work and struggle---to develop an astral body
   - can live beyond death
-- reincarnation
-- not immortal but can live past physical death
-friction between the struggle of yes/no can ... "crystallize" desire?
  -- can take place on wrong foundation
      -- fear of sin
      -- fanaticism
	  -- melted down but  via terrible suffering
	  how to evoke this? -sacrifice during crystallization. -- grounded in a foundation of belief? pattern?
	  
not everyone payed the same *kind* of attention

carpet seller
preyed on weak customers sometimes 
-- carpets- playing role of carpet seller
--- rich lady bargaining -- all the carpets for a quarter of the price. then continued bargaining. but next day he left loll
-- what is he demonstrating by "playing role"  --  a fragment?
-- role study. of a Persian
	-- dance vs. day to day. no difference. life as a game. life as ___?

Why so secret ... why is this knowledge not transparent?
-- 1. not concealed
	-- not mysterious
	-- requires effort 
	-- must learn from those who know
-- 2. can't become common property
		- knowledge isn't always easily receivable. whether they want it or not
		can't belong to many. 
		- Knowledge is material. 
			-matter is always limited finite
			-knowledge is limited by a certain time/place
			-knowledge has different qualities based on quantity
			- large quantity in a given place by small group men/man is good results
			    - advantage knowledge preserved by the small group
				
			- s quantity by everyone no or negative results
			- why not injustice
				- majority don't even want it
				- times of madness, they become automatons
		
				- coincides with climate change, cataclysms 
				- WTF
				- collect the knowledge! save this shit

Immortality
  - individuality--unchangeable I, unchangeable will
  - CAN belong to man
  - see four rooms, 
  
Man:

-- can govern. can control physical body
--3rd bod. 
-- full power can control first two
-- more knowledge
--4th body
-- Cons. Full control over 1-3
-- basic new age idea
-- well into the 8-circuit parallel

***Can only be artificially cultivated within him*** -- ignored by most teaching
astral is a great luxury 
-man can live without
-can appear intellect/spiritual ...deception

First case, physical body only, directed by external influences
Desires, aversions, depend on accidental influences, mechanical
will is absent. desires only in everyday man
the Robot.
the Lower/circuits
Will is absent

Second case: 
control comes from higher bodies
Depends on influences of others bodies
there's one single whole "I"...a true individuality--unchangeable. able to overcome resistance, reluctance. 
There is contradictory desires from all the different "I's"
Will is present...a power over the contrary desires.
This is Free

Eastern teaching describes the functions:
vessel filled with metal powders
not related.
any change of the vessel changes powders . powders may appear at the top vice/versa
nothing permanent
this is our psychic life 
new positions may change our states 
we are to see the instability because it's impossible to stabilize. 
the powders can be fused. and a fire can heat, melt the powders and fuses them. then they are in a chemical compound that cannot be separated. (crystallization) 
vessel contents 
friction creates the fires, which heats the vessel.
if man panders, then no fire is created
the fire of the friction between y/n can crystallize 

the new crystal gets new properties, radioactive, magnetize. the new properties corresponds to the formation of body 3 and new powers can be attributed to the lower bodies

the work can make the three bodies permanent and access to body 3
then this foundation of body 4
this a true Man in the full sense
this man has more properties....
		-immortality.
			-traditions similar teachings
			-man in many rooms. 
			- until he is told there are other rooms full of treasures, then he becomes a seeker of all rooms
			-when unlocked, he becomes the master of the  house.
			- room four= immortality.
all traditions/work strive toward this immortality	

immortality seekers:
**Each must develop the rest for full development**
**attainments in one are useless without attainments in the others**
**All begin with renunciation of all attachments and duties in life and go to a desert**

fakir - struggle with work on room 1. the first body. strives for physical will. sufferings. torturing the body. physical exercises. motionless for hours--austerity. the remaining functions. straight to body 4--skips 2,3. a fakir can fakir by osmosis. a beggar in Persia, juggler in India, yogi in Europe. teacher. followers imitate. not really a true teacher. knows little, understands little. works blindly. 

monk - faith. religious feeling, sacrifice. strong emotion and imagination, long hard struggle with his second body. his feelings, faith. will over the emotions. Via the fourth room. skips room 1,3 room are undeveloped skips. fresh hardships. must develop yogi, fakir. few die before they get through. bhakti
there is a teacher, monk submits in obedience absolutely to the teacher ... in looking for ways of serving and obeying god. knows what he wants. guided by tradition, trust in teachers. believes in own efforts to satisfied god. 

yogi - works on 3rd room via knowledge. jnana. emotions and body are undeveloped. knows but cannot do. must develop body emotion mastery. skips 1,2. man must do nothing without a teacher. first must imitate and believe like the first two, but then becomes his own teacher. yogi knows what he wants and how to get it. knows about creating states via mental exercises. the yogi > monk > fakir

"As a matter of fact, if we take all the people who are neither fakirs, monks, nor yogis, and of whom we may say with confidence  that  they  never  will  be  either  fakirs,  monks,  or  yogis,  then  we  may  say  with undoubted certainty that their possibilities cannot be developed and will not be developed."
Man must admit the possibility of evolution despite its absurdity. understand def possibility and their potential development. 
their possibilities won't be developed 

in normal conditions 
seek for knowledge is hopeless as there are nothing in the west to develop such fakir, yogi schools. spiritualism sucks. 
reasoning for the 4th way:
-- doesn't require renunciation, retirement
-- begins further on than the way of the yogi.
-- prepare for the fourth way. serious preparation. 
-- living in favorable conditions. 
-- no definite forms like f,m,y
-- beginning is easier. able to work remaining in usual conditions. at the beginning
	-- the man/conditions corresponds to what he is.
-- artificial conditions, on the other hand won't touch a man's whole being
-- fourth way works on all three rooms at once. 
-- **a man must do upon understanding the work to be done**
-- opposed to faith. a man must do nothing until he his satisfied with the work. 
-- when one is to do the work in one room, one simultaneously does work on the other two rooms. while working on the mind, include Phys, emotional
-- Fourth way removes superfluous 
-- saves time!
-- the way of the sly man. -- the sly man knows the secret of the m,f,y they each don't know. 
-- yogi > monk > fakir

Artificial ways: 
-- temp results
-- wrong ways
-- finds room 4 is not yet known. and may be ... empty.

the more things change, the more they stay the same

Civ is violence and slavery -G
progress and civilization are just words. everything is the same as it was before -G

people are machines. people are blind and unconscious. actions corresponds to their nature, everything happens. progress can only appear as conscious efforts. no conscious effort in machines. a million machines are unconscious. and results in destruction and evolution. this is where all evil lies
