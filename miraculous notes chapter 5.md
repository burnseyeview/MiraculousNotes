3 dimensional universe
matter/force
higher dimensions etc.

Universe as ray of creation:

O - ABSOLUTE
O - ALL WORLDS
O - ALL SUNS
O - SUN
O - ALL PLANETS
O - EARTH
O - MOON

**G Universe**
- Mentions contradictions to science
- Moon is an unborn planet being born
- will become like earth and have own moon
- new link will be added to ray of creation
- earth to be like sun
- each world from 1-96 correspond to the number of forces, or orders of law, which govern the worlds in question
	- ABSOLUTE: one law
	- in the next world, 3, 6, 12...
- World 48, Earth:
	- 48 orders of laws operate which govern our lives
- if we were on the moon we would be utterly mechanical, 96 orders of laws, fewer possibilities of escape
- the will of the  Absolute is only manifested in the immediate world created by it within itself-- in world 3; 
- the immediate will of the Absolute does not reach world 6 and is manifested in it only in the form of mechanical laws
- world 3 the Absolute creates, as it were, a general plan of all the rest of the universe, which is then further developed mechanically. The will of the Absolute cannot manifest itself in subsequent worlds apart from this plan, and, in manifesting itself in accordance with this plan, it takes the form of mechanical laws.
- if the Absolute wanted to manifest its will, say, in our world, in opposition to the mechanical laws in operation there, it would then have to destroy all the worlds intermediate between itself and our world.
- A 'miracle' can only be a manifestation of laws which are unknown to men or rarely met with. 
- A 'miracle' is the manifestation in this world of the laws of another world.
- freeing ourselves from each of these laws brings close to absolute
- *end of the ray of creation, the growing end, so to speak, of the branch, is the moon. The energy for the growth, that is *
- for the development of the moon and for the formation of new shoots, goes to the moon from the earth, where it is created by the joint action of the sun, of all the other planets of the solar system, and of the earth itself. This energy is collected and preserved in a huge accumulator situated on the earth's surface. 
- This accumulator is organic life on earth. Organic life on earth feeds the moon. Everything living on the earth, people, animals, plants, is food for the moon. The moon is a huge living being feeding upon all that lives and grows on the earth.
- Moon: Electromagnet to organic life
- at death plants, souls feed the moon via electromagnetic attraction
- warms the moon to extend ray of creation
- souls at the moon, conditions of mineral life. outer darkness, gnashing of teeth
- moon influences living things as it sucks vitality from the earth
	- all man's actions controlled by moon
	- all evil deeds done by the moon
	- liberation through growth of mental powers/faculties is liberation from moon. liberation from mechanical life.

**Materiality**
- via ray of creation
- absolute is weighable and measurable?
- God can be calculated
- world, like man divided into categories
- ray of creation establishes 7 worlds within another
- absolute "materiality" different than the materiality of "all worlds" and so on
- constant is material
- changes are manifestations of force or energy
- vibrating matter
- matter containing atoms get incredibly denser as it increases in worlds
- matter of the worlds gets finer/uncharacteristic of material -- as it gets closer to  the absolute
- man is 'miniature universe'
	- study world by studying man
	- undeveloped man is unfinished world
	- relativity: before anything else it is necessary to understand the relativity of each thing and of each manifestation according to the place it occupies in the cosmic order
	
	**LAW OF 3**
	- find manifestations in everything
	- cosmic properties of each substance are first  by its place, and secondly by the force which is acting through it at the given moment.
	- each substance can conduct each of the three forces
		- active passive neutralizing
	- four aspects / states of a substance
		- conductor of the active force, "Carbon", C
		- conductor of the passive force, "oxygen" O 0?
		- conductor of the neutralizing force, "nitrogen", N
		- when no force is acting, hydrogen, H
	- four elements
	- Tarot
	- relation of 3 to 4 in tarot

**IMMORTALITY**
- man has possibility for existence after death
- carriage metaphor
- all things connected in the carriage must play together
- man works on both the body and the connections
- G. put a plus over the 'astral body' and a minus over the physical. [See Fig. 5c.] "In  a  man  with  three  bodies,  the  third  or  'mental  body'  is  active  in  relation  to  the  'astral body' and to the physical body; this means that the consciousness in the 'mental body' has complete power over the 'astral body' and over the physical body." G. put a plus over the 'mental body' and a minus over the 'astral' and the physical bodies, bracketed together. "In  a  man  with  four  bodies  the  active  body  is  the  fourth.  This  means  that  the  consciousness  in  the  fourth  body  has  complete  power  over  the  'mental,'  the  'astral,'  and the physical bodies." G.  put  a  plus  over  the  fourth  body  and  a  minus  over  the  other  three  bracketed  together
	- see fig 5
- "In man of two, three, and four bodies, the most active body also lives the longest, that is, it is 'immortal' in relation to a lower body."
- man 1
	- physical
	- earthly material
	- dust
	- not immortal
- man 2
	- planetary world material
	- can survive physical body death
	- not fully immortal as will die after a period 
- man 3
	- made of sun material 
	- can exist after "astral" man 2, death
- man 4
	- starry material
	- man possessing the fourth body is immortal within the limits of the solar system
- Fig 6
- God beat ace of trumps with a duce moment 

- Moon
- relationship to org life is like a clock weight
- move the weight the clock stops
- moon is like weight on organic life
	- all movements rely upon us and it's pressure
- the idea of a place in the cosmic order

- Universal Language
	- Lang vs being
	- three universal languages
		- 1 spoken and written in lang limits
		- 2 written is same for all people, math
		- 3 written / spoken same for all but lang disappears
		
- Religions validity
	- distorted, lack of coherent understanding, teachings forgotten
	- old rites meaning gone

- astral body
	- people can communicate over distance
	- must establish a connection between two people first, a trace of them
	- blood brotherhood rites
	- Christ knew he had to die - in remembrance he did the last supper. similar to blood brotherhood. real blood/flesh
