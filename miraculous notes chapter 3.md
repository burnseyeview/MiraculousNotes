**absence of unity in man**
- man is contiually changing even 1/2 hour
	- man is ivan, then peter, the matthew...etc.
	- ivan agrees but nicholas lies ... nicholas can't help but lies when op presents
	- multitudes of "me's" in one man
	- separate parts of organs and seperate consciousness
		- each knows it's own place -g
		- feet/hands know what to do
		- peters, ivans, nicholas all think they're master
		- no order in them--who ever gets the upper hand.
		- everyone is king for five min
	- man as several bodies
	- study phys bod
		- people may have 2,3 bodies?
	- man can't have a single "I"
	- no perm unchangeable "I"
	- whole never expresses itself as a whole, but as unknown small "I's"
	- man is always saying "I"
	- man's name is legion 
	- controlled by weather, by external influences
	- man doesn't know of it
	- a man's strength of I's is proportionate to the strength of his individual centers
	- each small "I" names itself after the whole
	- explains contradictions in man
	- all try to be master, not steward.
	- (temp) deputy steward can put the house in order to prep for Master

**Astral Body**
- how to know if astral body
 - can be seen in certain conditions, photographed
 - can be estab by functions
 - presence of certain functons establishes astral body presence
 - focus on physical, machine

**The Machine**
- mistake that we have 'one mind' conscious
- activity of the physical is controled by several minds
	- independant 
	- manifest in separate spheres

- G would diseminate the info slowly

**The Centers**
- First time was 3 centers
- Later added instictive center
- Later still, Sex center
	- never worked independantly--always dependent on other centers
	- 'wrong wrole of centers'
	- all centers would rob sex center of energy.
	- then wrong work/excitement would create wrong energy
	- seldom does sex center work of it's own energy
	- the three centers relate to each other, but sex center is neutralizing force in relation to instinctive and moving centers as active and passive forces.

- people would create theories beyond the basic idea
	- i.e. some groups held on to 3 centers idea not connected PDO

- some talk about people's confusion about centers despite growing 

**Evolution**
	- Man developing possibilities within himself that wouldn't happen naturally
	- man to take charge of change
	- unnecessary for nature
	- cooresponds to evolution of planets
	- humanity exists for the earth and for the needs and purposes of the earth.
	- man as conquest- no man serves nature for purose of regeneration
	- man as a whole to evolve is not necessary for the earth and can be fatal
	- the moon feeds on humanity/organic life
	- humanity is "food for the moon"
	- evolution may happen with appropriate methods
	- man must do so with the interests of the planetary world
		- man must outwit the forces that oppose mass humanity evolution
	- these obstacles help man to over come
	- evolution is conscious struggle
		- nature fores against it
	- man stands as a correlation of magnitudes 
		- cell to man 
		- man to universe
	- evolution of man is evol of consciousness
	- nature gave man knowledge of it's machine
