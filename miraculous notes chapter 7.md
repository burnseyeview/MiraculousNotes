- cosmic consciousness isn't defined well
	- daydreaming, intesified work of the emotional center
	- subjective emotional experience like dreams
	- first define consciousness anwyay 
	- Can know consciousness in self
	- define moments when close to consciousness
	- moments of consciousness are short separated by mechanical unciousness machine
	- work, act, speak without being consciousness
	- possibility of consciousness
	- principles: 
		- G question: most important thing to notice during self observ.
		- incessant flaws imposisble to stop
		- hard to distinguish between centers
		- wholeness of a sysstem...like an organism - PDO
		- most important: you do not remember your selves. you do not feel yoruselves. not consicous of selves. it observes mechanically. 
		- not I notice I observe I see.
		- first of all REMEMBER ONESELF while observing. these are the valued results
		- nobody nkows they are asleep
		- if a man knows he cannot remember himself, he is closer to his being

**REMEMBER MYSELF**
- I am walking-- feel the "I". can't think, speak. dim sensations
- short
- stopping thought light in yoga, reminded PDO of SR
- divided attention directed toward feeling of self, the other toward the action.
	- useful in practice. 
	- characteristic feature in SR
	- when observing, direct attn to object. 
	- when remebering myself, the attention appears, with two arrow heads one toward self, one toward observation.
	- directing the attentino on self without weakening is the difficulty.
	- SR is not like self analysis or self feeling. own flavor, own state
	- SR does happen naturally but rarely.--new unexpected surrounding. I am in this strange place.
		- danger
		- emotional states
		- early recollections of life was self remembering
		- moments of self remembering lasted in memory than whenthey were not.
		- memory inefficient
		- provides a new sensory experience
		- feeling houses in st. petersberg. while remembering self. sensations came up of themselves. 
		- unsuccessful observations
			- one walk, distractions everywhere. thread lost, found, lost and so on.
			- tobacco shop...two hours later lost it lol
			- "came to" recalled all the things
			- central thing to the system. 
			- psychology -- we are sleepign. 
		- ingroup understood
		- out group didn't .. took too lightly
		- this is not new ~others, an apoception

- study of man must run parallel to study of world
	- some laws easier observed in world, others, man
	- unity in everything. comparing different orders of phenomena
- laws of three
	- first law of universe. positive, neg, neutralizing
**Law of Seven (of octaves)**
- universe consistes of vibraions of all kinds
- before natural vib weakening, resistance, the vibs develop uniformly in absense of resistance (per science of the time)
- force of original vibrations are not uniform 
- vibrations determined on anture of impulse etc
- vibs slowdown, change nature direction, acend slow, descend slow. a temp retardation
- vibs enter uniformly until a chekc in their development
- vibs double as they increase
- say 1000/sec after a time it doubles
- during this interval there are two places where retardation and decrease of vib.
	- near begining
	- near end
	- divided into 8 steps with step 8 repeating the first. an octave
	- 8 unequal parts
- 7 tone scale forgotten and refound. a formula of a cosmic law woprked out by ancient schools and applied to music
- 7 tone scale is a good foundation for the law
- begins wiht 1000 vibs / sec call it Do. frequency increases, by 2000/sec Do again but of the next octave
- Do Re will be 9/8....
	- (just look at all the diagrams. not notating all that.)
- law of octaves create a circle through the semitones between ra and si
- known to ancient knowledge
- during some points in the octaves require additioanal 'shock'
- the big cosmic octave forms the ray  of creation beginning with the ALL.
- then divided further 
- organic life on earth transmits to earth all the influences requried. 
- then the moon is re then back to Do.. nothing
- Holy trinity absolute or all, absolute or Nothing, and between all and nothing is the Ray of Creation.
- a plan of the universe
